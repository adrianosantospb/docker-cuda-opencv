# Docker image for C++/Python software development with OpenCV/CUDA

* Based on nvidia-docker2 image Ubuntu 16.04 / CUDA 9.1 / cuDNN 7
* Adds CMake 3.10.2 to use improved CUDA CMake integration
* Adds miniconda with two environments to build Python 2.7 and 3.6 OpenCV bindings
* Leverages conda to pull Intel MKL headers and shared libraries
* Adds Eigen 3.3.4 
* Adds TBB
* Builds OpenCV with all the above (OpenCV cmake generation downloads several other packages like Intel IPP)

Example:

```
nvidia-docker run --rm -ti mlamarre/docker-cuda-opencv:latest /bin/bash
/# source activate ocvpy3
(ocvpy3) /# python
>>> import cv2
```

To call Python scripts using cv2 inside following RUN command do this first:

```
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source /opt/conda/envs/ocvpy3/bin/activate"]
```

This activates the conda environment with the installed cv2.pyd inside the docker shell.
